# ConsumeLess: The Borrowing App

This was the final 2 week long project of my 16 month software engineering course at Makers Academy.

The aim of the project was to create an app that could benefit the community and help the environment. We designed an app that would allow users to borrow items from other users in their area free of charge.

This would encourage people to consume less and borrow more.
